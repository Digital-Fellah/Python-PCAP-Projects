"""
EXPLANATION OF THE CODE

The program starts with a welcome message and an introduction to set the scene of a forest with three paths.
It prompts the player to choose one of the paths using input() and processes the choice using string methods like .strip() and .lower() for cleaning and normalization.
Based on the player's first choice, it branches into different storylines using conditional statements (if, elif, else).
Each branch involves further player interaction through additional input() prompts and conditional checks.
Finally, it concludes with a simple ending message.
