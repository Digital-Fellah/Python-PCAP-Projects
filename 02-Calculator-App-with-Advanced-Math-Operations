EXPLANATION OF THE CODE

Importing necessary functions from the math module: This brings specific functions from the math module into our script.
Define a function for addition: Function to add two numbers.
Define a function for subtraction: Function to subtract the second number from the first.
Define a function for multiplication: Function to multiply two numbers.
Define a function for division: Function to divide the first number by the second, with error handling for division by zero.
Define a function for ceiling operation: Function to return the smallest integer greater than or equal to a number.
Define a function for floor operation: Function to return the largest integer less than or equal to a number.
Define a function for square root calculation: Function to return the square root of a number.
Define a function for factorial calculation: Function to return the factorial of a number.
Main function to demonstrate the calculator operations: Function to display results of all operations.
Check if this script is being run directly: This ensures the main function runs only when the script is executed directly, not when imported as a module.

NOTIONS COVERED

Import variants (import, from import): Demonstrated by importing specific functions from the math module.
Math module functions (ceil(), floor(), sqrt(), factorial()): Used in the defined functions to perform advanced mathematical operations.
User-defined modules (calculator.py module): The script can be considered a user-defined module with functions encapsulating various operations.
__init__.py file: Not explicitly shown, but implied if organizing functions into a package.
Advanced qualifying for nested modules: Understanding of how to structure code and use functions from a module.
__name__ variable: Used to check the script execution context, ensuring the main function runs correctly.
