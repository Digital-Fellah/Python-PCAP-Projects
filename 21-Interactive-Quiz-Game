# Interactive Quiz Game with Lambda Functions
# This program creates a simple interactive quiz game where users answer Python-related questions.

# Define quiz questions as a list of tuples containing question and correct answer pairs

    ("What is the largest planet in our solar system?", "Jupiter"),
    ("What is the command to print in Python?", "print()"),
    ("Who is the creator of Python?", "Guido van Rossum"),
    ("What is 2 + 2?", "4")

        print(question)
        user_answer = input("Your answer: ")

        if check_answer(user_answer, correct_answer):

"""
EXPLANATION OF THE CODE

Define a list quiz_questions containing tuples of questions and correct answers.
Use a lambda function check_answer to compare user input with correct answers.
Implement run_quiz() function to iterate through questions, prompt user for answers, and calculate score.
Display final score after all questions are answered.

NOTIONS COVERED

Lambda functions: Defined check_answer lambda function to compare user input with correct answers.
Functions (map(), filter()): Utilized input() for user interaction and print() for output.
Miscellaneous: Basic I/O operations (input() for user answers, print() for displaying questions and feedback).
